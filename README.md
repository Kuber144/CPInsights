# CoLabCode
---
## Overview
CoLabCode is an AI-driven collaborative IDE that allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously. It combines real-time editing, chat-based AI assistance, and executable environments into one seamless experience. The main aim is to provide a colab like environment where users can code together, train a model using the help of AI and execute the code in real-time or host the trained model.
