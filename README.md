# CPInsights - AI-Powered Competitive Programming Code Review Assistant

## Overview
CPInsights is an intelligent code analysis platform designed specifically for competitive programmers. It analyzes submissions from Codeforces and LeetCode, detects algorithmic patterns, provides optimization suggestions, and explains solution approaches with detailed complexity analysis. Built by competitive programmers, for competitive programmers.

## Key Features

### Algorithmic Pattern Detection
- Automatically identifies algorithm categories (DP, Greedy, Graph Theory, Binary Search, etc.)
- Matches code against 1000+ known algorithmic patterns using AST analysis and vector embeddings
- Provides pattern-based practice recommendations

### Solution Analysis
- Time and space complexity analysis with mathematical proofs
- Line-by-line execution flow explanation
- Comparison with editorial solutions
- Identifies potential optimizations and edge cases

### Test Case Debugging
- Explains why specific test cases passed or failed
- Generates additional test cases based on identified weaknesses
- Provides counter-examples for wrong approaches

### Contest Integration
- Real-time submission analysis during contests
- Historical performance tracking across platforms
- Rating prediction based on solving patterns
- Personalized problem recommendations

### Learning Features
- Explains algorithmic intuition behind solutions
- Suggests alternative approaches with trade-offs
- Links to similar problems for practice
- Tracks improvement in specific algorithm categories

## Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- Tree-sitter for AST parsing and code structure analysis
- Anthropic Claude API / OpenAI GPT-4 for code explanation and reasoning
- Vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) for pattern matching
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Celery for async task processing

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Monaco Editor for code display
- Chart.js for analytics visualization

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Nginx for reverse proxy
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## System Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

1. **Ingestion Layer**: Fetches submissions via Codeforces/LeetCode APIs
2. **Analysis Engine**: AST parsing, pattern matching, LLM-based reasoning
3. **Storage Layer**: PostgreSQL for metadata, vector DB for embeddings
4. **API & Frontend**: REST API and React dashboard for user interaction

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed design documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- API keys for Claude/OpenAI
- Pinecone/Weaviate account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CPInsights.git
cd CPInsights

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start services with Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following:

```env
# LLM Configuration
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Vector Database
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_environment

# Database
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=CPInsights
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# API Keys for Scraping
CODEFORCES_API_KEY=optional
LEETCODE_SESSION_COOKIE=optional
```

## Usage

### Analyzing a Submission

```bash
# Via CLI
python cli.py analyze --platform codeforces --submission-id 123456789

# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "code": "your code here",
    "problem_id": "1234A",
    "platform": "codeforces",
    "language": "cpp"
  }'
```

### Web Interface
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and:
1. Paste your submission code or provide submission URL
2. Select problem and platform
3. View analysis results with pattern detection, complexity, and suggestions

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/analyze` - Analyze code submission
- `GET /api/submissions/:id` - Get analysis results
- `GET /api/patterns` - List all detected patterns
- `GET /api/similar/:submission_id` - Find similar solutions
- `GET /api/recommendations/:user_id` - Get personalized practice problems
- `GET /api/contests/:contest_id/analysis` - Contest performance analysis
